Now, even if you cant be sure that you are working with one of these systems you can still have a way to check if something is a float or an integer thanks to this snippet.\r\n\r\n<h2><code>YourJS.isFloat(x)<\/code> API Documentation<\/h2>\r\n<div style=\"margin: 0 30px 30px;\">\r\n  <h3>Description<\/h3>\r\n  <div>Determines whether or not a number is a float.
